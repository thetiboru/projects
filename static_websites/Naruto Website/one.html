                        <h3>Storyline</h3>
                        <p>The Original Naruto story had the main character Naruto being a chef. The story was tweaked and he became a boy who could transform into a fox. Ultimatley both these storylines were scrapped and the show became about ninjas. The storyline of Naruto is primarily based on Japanese culture, including popular Japanese tales like the Nine-Tailed Fox. Author Kishimoto also made use of the Chinese zodiac tradition when developing some of the hand signs frequently used in the show. </p>

                        <p>Kishimoto admits that a lot of the inspiration from Naruto came from the Japanese anime known as Hunter x Hunter. Togashi, the creator of Hunter x Hunter, was good friends with Kishimoto and they shared a lot of ideas. Some of the characters Kishimoto took inspiration from were Sasuke, Orochimaru, Kakashi, and Madara.</p>
